"""macOS Seatbelt (`sandbox-exec`) backend (architecture doc §2.3.1).

This is the v1-default backend on macOS for the shared sandbox executor.
It generates a Seatbelt Scheme-based SBPL (Sandbox Profile Language)
profile from a :class:`~lazycore.sandbox.base.SandboxPolicy` and invokes
``/usr/bin/sandbox-exec -f <profile> -- <command>`` via :mod:`subprocess`.

**Read this before touching GPU/Metal anything.** Per §2.3.1's research
findings, Seatbelt is confirmed to be a real, production-used isolation
primitive for constraining untrusted *tool-calling* processes on macOS
(used by Gemini CLI and other "agent-in-a-sandbox" projects) -- but it is
also confirmed that **Seatbelt cannot block or gate Metal/GPU/Cocoa access
even if you wanted it to**: "GPU and display passthrough flags have no
effect on macOS because Metal and Cocoa are system-level and cannot be
blocked via SBPL." Seatbelt is a process-level filesystem/network/syscall
allowlist, not a VM/kernel boundary, and it has no mechanism to mediate the
GPU driver stack at all. This module therefore does not attempt to add any
GPU-blocking rule to the generated profile -- there is no such rule to add.
Per the locked split-trust architecture, GPU-bound model inference is
expected to run *outside* this sandbox entirely; this executor only ever
constrains the CPU-bound tool-calling/code-execution layer (shell commands,
file I/O, network egress).

#: This previously also included ``"Sandbox: "`` and ``"deny("``, which are

#: ``Sandbox: cat(1234) deny(1) file-read-data ...``). That line is written
#: to the system unified log via ``os_log``/ASL, not to the sandboxed
#: process's own stdout/stderr -- ``subprocess.run(..., capture_output=True)``
#: never sees it, so these two markers could never actually match anything
#: this backend captures and were dead code. Capturing that log line for
#: real would require running a concurrent ``log stream``/``log show``
#: collector alongside every sandboxed invocation and correlating its

#: in principle, but it needs extra process-management complexity, a
#: predicate stable across macOS versions, and (on some macOS versions)

    ``json.dumps()`` on its own is too permissive for this security
    boundary: it *coerces* rather than rejects several Python types on
    encode, so "it round-tripped through ``json.dumps``/``json.load``
    without an exception" is not the same guarantee as "the sandboxed
    child sees exactly the value the caller passed". Concretely:

    - A ``tuple`` serializes to a JSON array **indistinguishable** from a
      ``list`` -- the child's ``json.load()`` always reconstructs a
      ``list``, so a caller who bound a tuple argument via
      ``functools.partial`` would silently have it replaced with a list
      of the same elements inside the sandbox: a different runtime
      type/value than what was actually requested, for what may be a
      security- or correctness-sensitive call.
    - A non-``str`` dict key (e.g. an ``int`` key) is silently stringified
      by ``json.dumps`` (``{1: "a"}`` becomes ``{"1": "a"}`` on the wire),
      again changing what the child actually receives relative to what
      the caller specified.

    This function walks ``value`` and only accepts ``str``, ``int``,
    ``float``, ``bool``, ``None``, ``list`` (recursing into elements), and
    ``dict`` with string-only keys (recursing into values) -- explicitly
    rejecting ``tuple`` (even though ``json.dumps`` happily accepts it),
    any non-``str`` dict key, and any other type (``set``, custom class
    instances, etc.).

    NaN/Infinity/-Infinity floats are deliberately *not* rejected here --
    plain ``float`` is a legitimate JSON-native scalar type, and
    ``json.dumps(..., allow_nan=False)`` (used at the actual serialization
    call sites, see :func:`_validate_run_callable_arguments`) already
    raises ``ValueError`` for those specific values with a clear message.
    Duplicating that check here would just be two ways to catch the same

        path: A human-readable description of ``value``'s location within

            precise error message (e.g. ``"args[0]"``, ``"kwargs['x'][2]"``).

    **Rejection messages never call ``repr()``/``str()`` on the untrusted,
    already-invalid ``value`` (or a non-``str`` dict key).** This is the
    same vulnerability class already fixed twice elsewhere in this module
    (attacker-controlled dunder methods -- there, ``__eq__``/``__ne__``/
    ``__contains__``; here, ``__repr__``/``__str__``): calling ``repr()``
    on an arbitrary object invokes ``value.__repr__()``, which a malicious
    class could override to run arbitrary code the moment this function
    tries to *report* that the value is invalid -- i.e. even the "we're
    rejecting this" path is not safe unless it avoids touching the object
    itself. Error messages below therefore only ever use
    ``type(value).__name__`` (an attribute access on the *type* object, not
    a method call on the untrusted instance -- always safe) and the
    caller-constructed, already-known-safe ``path`` string, never a
    ``repr()``/``str()``/f-string ``!r``/``!s`` of ``value`` itself. The one
    exception is a dict key already confirmed to be exactly ``str`` (not a

def build_sbpl_profile(policy: SandboxPolicy) -> str:
    """Generate an SBPL (Sandbox Profile Language) profile string for ``policy``.

    Profile structure:

    - ``(version 1)`` / ``(deny default)`` -- default-deny baseline.
    - A small fixed set of ``allow`` rules needed for *any* process to
      start and exit cleanly (fork, signal-to-self, sysctl-read,
      file-read-metadata) -- these are not policy-configurable because
      they are required for basic process lifecycle, not for accessing
      user data.
    - **Reads: default-deny.** ``policy.allowed_read_paths`` being empty
      (the default) means the sandboxed process has **no user-data read
      access at all** -- not "unrestricted reads". Reads are always
      restricted to exactly the union of two sets: (1) a small, fixed,
      non-configurable set of backend-owned bootstrap paths needed for
      *any* process to start at all on macOS (dynamic linker/shared
      libraries, coreutils, system frameworks, locale/timezone data, and
      the running Python interpreter's own install prefix -- see
      :func:`_bootstrap_read_paths`), and (2) whatever
      ``policy.allowed_read_paths`` explicitly lists. **If your command
      needs to read a file, you must list it (or its containing directory)
      in ``allowed_read_paths`` -- an empty tuple grants zero access to the
      home directory, arbitrary ``/tmp`` contents, project files, secrets,
      or any other user data.**
    - **Writes:** always restricted to ``policy.allowed_write_paths``
      (subpath-based). An empty tuple (the default) means no writes are
      allowed anywhere -- this is the primary enforcement demonstrated by
      this backend's tests.
    - **Network:** ``(allow network*)`` only if ``policy.allow_network`` is
      True; otherwise omitted, so the default-deny baseline blocks all
      network egress.
    - **Executables:** if ``policy.allowed_executables`` is non-empty,
      ``process-exec`` is restricted to those literal paths; otherwise
      ``process-exec`` is left unrestricted (needed for ordinary shell
      commands to exec `/bin/sh`, coreutils, `python3`, etc.). Each entry
      is resolved via :func:`_resolve_allowed_executable`, not plain
      ``Path.resolve()``: a bare name with no path separator (e.g.
      ``"python3"``) is resolved against ``PATH`` via :func:`shutil.which`
      -- resolving it with ``Path.resolve()`` instead would silently
      produce a bogus path relative to the current working directory
      (``<cwd>/python3``) that the real executable never matches. An entry
      that already looks like a path is resolved exactly as before.

    **Anti-widening check on read/write paths.** Each entry in
    ``allowed_read_paths``/``allowed_write_paths`` is resolved via
    :func:`_reject_overbroad_allowed_path`, not plain ``Path.resolve()``:
    this raises ``ValueError`` (refusing to build the profile at all)
    rather than silently emitting a ``subpath`` rule if an entry resolves
    to a filesystem root or another suspiciously broad system directory
    (see that function's docstring for exactly what is and is not caught --
    it is a targeted check, not a general anti-symlink/anti-traversal
    mechanism).

    Never adds, and will never add, any rule attempting to gate GPU/Metal/
    Cocoa access -- see the module docstring.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If an ``allowed_read_paths``/``allowed_write_paths``

class SeatbeltSandboxExecutor(BaseSandboxExecutor):
    """Sandbox executor backed by macOS's `sandbox-exec`/Seatbelt.

    Restricts filesystem reads/writes, network egress, and (optionally)
    which executables may be exec'd by the tool-calling/code-execution
    layer. Never attempts, and cannot in principle (per §2.3.1), gate GPU/
    Metal/Cocoa access -- inference processes must be run outside this
    sandbox entirely, per the platform's split-trust architecture.

    **Stricter contract than the original implementation:**

    - **Reads are default-deny.** An empty ``allowed_read_paths`` means the
      sandboxed process can read *only* a small, fixed set of
      backend-owned bootstrap paths needed to execute a process at all
      (dynamic linker/shared libraries, coreutils, system frameworks,
      locale/timezone data, and the running Python interpreter's own
      install prefix) -- it grants **no** access to the home directory,
      arbitrary ``/tmp`` contents, project files, or any other user data.
      If your command needs to read a file, you must list it (or its
      containing directory) in ``allowed_read_paths`` explicitly. See
      :func:`build_sbpl_profile` and :func:`_bootstrap_read_paths` for the
      exact bootstrap set.
    - ``run_callable()`` never pickles the caller-supplied callable in this
      (trusted, host) process -- only a plain module-level function, or a
      ``functools.partial`` wrapping one with JSON-serializable bound
      arguments, is accepted. Its identity is validated in this process
      purely via ``func.__globals__`` introspection (never by importing
      ``func.__module__``, which is a freely rewritable string an attacker
      could point anywhere); the function is only ever imported by
      ``(module, qualname)`` and called *inside* the sandboxed child
      process. See :meth:`run_callable`'s and
      :meth:`_resolve_module_level_function`'s docstrings.
    - ``SandboxPolicy.allowed_read_paths``/``allowed_write_paths``/
      ``working_directory`` must be absolute paths, enforced eagerly by
      :class:`~lazycore.sandbox.base.SandboxPolicy`'s own
      ``__post_init__`` -- a relative entry raises ``ValueError`` at
      policy-construction time, not when ``run_command()`` happens to be
      called from a different working directory later.
    - ``allowed_read_paths``/``allowed_write_paths`` entries are rejected
      with ``ValueError`` (profile build refused entirely) if they resolve
      to a filesystem root or another suspiciously broad system directory
      -- see :func:`_reject_overbroad_allowed_path`. This is a targeted
      anti-widening check, not a general anti-symlink mechanism; benign,
      well-known OS symlinks (e.g. ``/tmp`` -> ``/private/tmp``) are
      unaffected.
    - ``SandboxResult.policy_blocked`` is still a best-effort heuristic,
      never a guarantee, but is more precise than plain substring matching
      against stdout/stderr: it cross-references the specific command and
      the policy actually in effect for that call to rule out the common
      false-positive case of an ordinary POSIX/DAC permission error (e.g.
      a chmod 000 file) that has nothing to do with Seatbelt -- see
      :meth:`_classify_denial`. It still cannot see Seatbelt's own denial
      logging (written to the unified log, not to the sandboxed process's
      captured stdout/stderr), and it still cannot classify commands
      outside its small internal allowlist with the same precision.

        **Historical note (retired precision case).** An earlier version of
        this method downgraded a "Permission denied"/"Operation not
        permitted" report to ``policy_blocked=False`` whenever the failing
        command was a member of ``_READ_ONLY_COMMAND_BASENAMES`` *and*
        ``policy.allowed_read_paths`` was empty -- reasoning that
        :func:`build_sbpl_profile` at the time emitted an unconditional,
        completely unrestricted ``(allow file-read*)`` for an empty
        ``allowed_read_paths``, so Seatbelt could not structurally have
        caused the denial. That invariant no longer holds: per the Finding-1
        fix, :func:`build_sbpl_profile` now *always* restricts reads to a
        fixed bootstrap set plus ``allowed_read_paths`` (never fully
        unrestricted, regardless of whether ``allowed_read_paths`` is
        empty), so a read-only command failing under *any* policy could
        genuinely be a Seatbelt denial (e.g. the file being read is outside
        both the bootstrap set and ``allowed_read_paths``) rather than only
        ever an ordinary DAC error. Downgrading based on command basename
        alone is therefore no longer sound, and this method no longer does
        it -- ``_READ_ONLY_COMMAND_BASENAMES`` is retained only for
        documentation/potential future use (e.g. if this method is later
        extended to inspect which specific path a command tried to read and
        compare it against the granted set), not used by this method's

        function and return its ``(module_name, qualname)``.

        Rejects anything that is not re-importable by name: lambdas, local
        closures, bound/unbound methods, callable class instances, and
        (crucially) any object whose ``__reduce__``/``__reduce_ex__`` could
        run attacker-controlled code if it were ever pickled -- this
        function never pickles ``func``.

        **This validation never imports anything.** An earlier version of
        this method verified ``func.__module__``/``__qualname__`` by calling
        ``importlib.import_module(module_name)`` directly in this (trusted,
        host) process and attribute-chasing ``qualname`` on the result. That
        was itself a vulnerability of the same shape as the original
        pickle-based Finding 2: ``__module__`` is a plain, freely writable
        string attribute on any function object (``func.__module__ =
        "attacker/controlled/module"`` is valid Python with no special
        privileges required), so a caller -- or anything upstream that
        constructs "a function" and hands it to ``run_callable`` -- could
        make this host process import and execute arbitrary module-level
        code *before* the identity check even ran, let alone before the
        sandbox existed.

        Instead, this method validates identity purely via introspection of
        ``func.__globals__`` -- the dict object that *is* the namespace
        ``func`` was actually defined in. Unlike ``__module__``/
        ``__qualname__``, ``__globals__`` is not a re-assignable string that
        can be pointed somewhere else after the fact by simple attribute
        assignment; it is fixed to the defining module's namespace at
        function-creation time. Three checks, none of which ever import
        anything:

        1. ``qualname`` must be a flat, undotted name -- i.e. ``func`` must
           be bound directly at module level, not nested inside a class or
           another function. (Bound/nested names would require attribute-
           chasing through ``__globals__``, which a dict lookup by full
           qualname string cannot do; since this method's whole contract is
           "module-level functions", rejecting dotted names is a
           tightening, not a regression.)
        2. ``func.__globals__["__name__"]`` (the *actual* module ``func`` was
           defined in) must equal ``func.__module__`` (the caller-visible,
           possibly-tampered claim). If these disagree, ``__module__`` has
           been reassigned since definition and is untrustworthy -- reject
           without ever importing ``module_name`` to find out.
        3. ``func.__globals__[qualname]`` must be ``func`` itself -- i.e.
           the name still resolves, inside its own defining namespace, to
           the exact same function object (not a reassigned/shadowed name).

        The actual ``importlib.import_module(module_name)`` call for this
        ``(module_name, qualname)`` pair happens later, but only ever inside
        the already-sandboxed child process (see the runner script built by
        :meth:`run_callable`) -- never here in the host.

        **Plain-``str`` type check happens before anything else.**
        ``__module__`` and ``__qualname__`` are ordinary, freely-writable
        attributes on a function object -- nothing stops
        ``func.__module__ = some_object`` where ``some_object`` is not even
        a string. If that were allowed through, the very next line of
        defense (``"<lambda>" in qualname``, or
        ``globals_dict.get("__name__") != module_name``) would perform a
        containment check or rich comparison *against attacker-supplied
        input*, which for a custom object means invoking that object's
        ``__contains__``/``__eq__``/``__ne__`` dunder methods -- in this
        trusted host process, before the sandbox exists. That is the exact
        same class of vulnerability as the already-fixed
        ``importlib.import_module(func.__module__)`` bug this method's
        docstring describes above: it doesn't matter whether the untrusted
        value is *imported* or merely *compared*, either way attacker code
        runs unsandboxed. So every value later used in a comparison,
        containment check, or f-string built from untrusted metadata --
        ``qualname``, ``module_name``, and ``globals_dict.get("__name__")``
        -- is required to be an exact ``str`` (``type(x) is str``, not
        ``isinstance(x, str)``, since a ``str`` subclass could itself

        **Never pickles ``func`` in this (trusted, host) process.** Since
        Seatbelt sandboxes an OS process, not an in-process Python call,
        this needs some way to hand ``func`` to a fresh child interpreter --
        but calling :func:`pickle.dumps` on an arbitrary, possibly
        attacker-influenced callable *before* the sandbox exists would
        invoke that object's ``__reduce__``/``__reduce_ex__`` unsandboxed,
        which is itself an arbitrary-code-execution vector (this was
        Finding 2). Instead:

        1. ``func`` must be a plain module-level function, or a
           :func:`functools.partial` wrapping one (see
           :meth:`_decompose_callable`). Its identity is validated purely
           via ``func.__globals__`` introspection (see
           :meth:`_resolve_module_level_function`) -- this host process
           never calls :func:`importlib.import_module` on the caller's
           (freely rewritable) ``__module__`` string to do this, since that
           would import and execute attacker-influenced module code here,
           before the sandbox even exists.
        2. Any bound arguments (from the ``functools.partial``, if used)
           must be genuinely JSON-*native* -- validated via
           :func:`_validate_run_callable_arguments` (Finding 3 fix), never
           :mod:`pickle`, since pickle is unsafe for untrusted data on the
           way out of the sandbox too. This is stricter than "passes
           ``json.dumps()`` without raising": a bare ``json.dumps()`` call
           would silently *coerce* a ``tuple`` argument into a
           JSON-array-that-looks-like-a-list (so the child would
           reconstruct a ``list`` where a ``tuple`` was actually bound) and
           silently stringify non-``str`` dict keys, either of which means
           the sandboxed child could end up executing a subtly different
           call than the one requested. ``allow_nan=False`` is also passed
           at every actual serialization call site so
           NaN/Infinity/-Infinity floats raise ``ValueError`` instead of
           being written as non-standard, potentially-ambiguous JSON.
        3. ``(module_name, qualname, args, kwargs)`` is written as plain
           JSON to a small file in a temporary directory alongside a
           runner script, and :meth:`run_command` executes
           ``python <runner> <payload.json>`` under the sandbox. The
           *child* (already-sandboxed) process is the one that calls
           ``importlib.import_module(module_name)`` and resolves/calls the
           function -- exactly the "perform importing inside Seatbelt"
           structure the finding asked for.

        The runner captures the callable's return value via ``repr()`` on
        stdout, or a traceback plus a nonzero exit code if it raises. The
        temporary directory (and the harness's own runner/payload files
        within it) is always granted read access regardless of the
        caller's policy, since it is internal plumbing rather than user
        data.

            TypeError: If ``func`` (or a ``functools.partial``'s ``.func``)
