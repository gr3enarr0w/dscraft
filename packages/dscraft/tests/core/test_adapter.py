"""Tests for dscraft.core.adapter -- the shared BaseSandboxedAdapter base
class both ``dscraft.agent.adapter.AgentAdapter`` and
``dscraft.security.adapter.BaseSecurityAdapter`` build on (architecture doc
§2.3's "one ... adapter base class" requirement).

``BaseSandboxedAdapter`` itself is deliberately thin (no state, no abstract
methods of its own -- see its docstring), so these tests focus on the two
things that are genuinely worth asserting in isolation: that both module
adapter bases really do inherit from it (proving the "one shared base"
architecture decision is actually satisfied in code, not just in
docstrings), and that its one piece of shared logic --
``_require_sandbox_executor`` -- behaves correctly on both valid and
invalid input, independent of either concrete module.
